### Hello, I am Max, I'm a 17 yr old student, who specialises in Bullshittery and writing unreadable shitslop of code,

I have been programming since the age of 12, starting off with Python. Which I stuck with for nearly 4 years before I gained sentience and realised every other language except C and C++ is government propaganda and every person who uses then should be forced to learn hash tables for the rest of time.
